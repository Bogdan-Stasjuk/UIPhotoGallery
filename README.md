# UIPhotoGallery

**UIPhotoGallery** is a set of extended & customizable views to show Photo Gallery for iOS UIKit. This library contains 2 main components: **UIPhotoGalleryView** & **UIPhotoGalleryViewController**.

## DataSource, Delegate, Mode & Style

UIPhotoGallery is implemented in UITableView style, which uses **dataSource** and **delegate** pointers to contruct UI components.

### DataSource, Mode & Style

To declare number of views showing in gallery:

	- (NSInteger)numberOfViewsInPhotoGallery:(UIPhotoGalleryView*)photoGallery;
	
To declare a view component in specific index:

	- (UIImage*)photoGallery:(UIPhotoGalleryView*)photoGallery localImageAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
	- (NSURL*)photoGallery:(UIPhotoGalleryView*)photoGallery remoteImageURLAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
	- (UIView*)photoGallery:(UIPhotoGalleryView*)photoGallery customViewAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
	
At a moment, **_only 1_** method will be used to contruct view components for gallery, depends on UIPhotoGalleryView's **galleryMode** property. So far, there are 3 modes supported:

	UIPhotoGalleryModeImageLocal
    UIPhotoGalleryModeImageRemote
    UIPhotoGalleryModeCustomView

To declare a caption component in specific index:
	
	- (NSString*)photoGallery:(UIPhotoGalleryView*)photoGallery plainTextCaptionAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
	- (NSAttributedString*)photoGallery:(UIPhotoGalleryView*)photoGallery attributedTextCaptionAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
	- (UIView*)photoGallery:(UIPhotoGalleryView*)photoGallery customViewCaptionAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;

Similar to view component, **_only one_** caption contruction method is used at a moment to contruct caption for gallery item, depends on UIPhotoGalleryView's **captionStyle**, including 3 supported styles so far:

	UIPhotoCaptionStylePlainText
    UIPhotoCaptionStyleAttributedText
    UIPhotoCaptionStyleCustomView

### Delegate

So far, UIPhotoGallery provides 2 delegate methods:

	- (void)photoGallery:(UIPhotoGalleryView*)photoGallery didTapAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
	- (void)photoGallery:(UIPhotoGalleryView*)photoGallery didDoubleTapAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;
	- (UIPhotoGalleryDoubleTapHandler)photoGallery:(UIPhotoGalleryView*)photoGallery doubleTapHandlerAtIndex:(NSInteger)index;

Use **photoGallery:didTapAtIndex:** method to handle single tap at gallery item.

Use **photoGallery:doubleTapHandlerAtIndex:** method to set default action for double tap gesture recognizer. Options including:

	UIPhotoGalleryDoubleTapHandlerNone
    UIPhotoGalleryDoubleTapHandlerZoom
    UIPhotoGalleryDoubleTapHandlerCustom
 
If this method return **UIPhotoGalleryDoubleTapHandlerZoom**, current photo item  will be zoomed at tapping position. If **UIPhotoGalleryDoubleTapHandlerCustom** returned, action will be dispatched to **photoGallery:didDoubleTapAtIndex:** if  implemented. Otherwise, if **UIPhotoGalleryDoubleTapHandlerNone** returned, nothing happens.

## UIPhotoGalleryView

### Properties

There are several properties that are helpful to quickly customize your gallery

	@property (nonatomic, assign) UIPhotoGalleryMode galleryMode;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) UIPhotoCaptionStyle captionStyle;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL peakSubView;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL verticalGallery;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat subviewGap;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) NSInteger initialIndex;
	
As mentioned above, **galleryMode** and **captionStyle** are used to change gallery's mode (showing local images, remote images or custom views) and caption style (plain texts, attributed texts or custom views). By default, **galleryMode** is set to **UIPhotoGalleryModeLocalImage** and **captionStyle** is set to **UIPhotoCaptionStylePlainText**.

Use **peakSubView** to enable/disable gallery item's peak (draw items outside the UIPhotoGallery's frame). By default, this property is set to **NO**.

	vPhotoGallery.peakSubView = YES;

Use **verticalGallery** to set gallery's scroll direction to horizontal/vertical. By default, this property is set to **NO** (horizontal scrolling).

	vPhotoGallery.verticalGallery = YES;

Use **subviewGap** to adjust a blank gap between gallery items. By default, this property is set to **30.0**.

	vPhotoGallery.subviewGap = 50;

Use **initialIndex** to set the initial position when view is loaded. By default, this property is set to **0**.

	vPhotoGallery.initialIndex = 4;

**_Note:_** all of these properties may be set during runtime, your gallery will change right after setters are called without any additional methods calling.

### Methods

Comming along with properties to customize gallery's style, some helper methods are provided to control the scrolling of your gallery.

	- (void)setInitialIndex:(NSInteger)initialIndex animated:(BOOL)animation;
	- (BOOL)scrollToPage:(NSInteger)page animated:(BOOL)animation;
	- (BOOL)scrollToBesidePage:(NSInteger)delta animated:(BOOL)animation;
	
The method **setInitialIndex:animated:** is an alternative way to animate the initialization page setup. The default **initialIndex** property has no animation effect.

	[vPhotoGallery setInitialIndex:4 animated:YES];
	
	[vPhotoGallery setInitialIndex:4 animated:NO]; // Equivalent to vPhotoGallery.initialIndex = 4;

The method **scrollToBeSidePage** use a NSInteger **delta** param to scroll to the next or previous delta pages from current page.

	[vPhotoGallery scrollToBesidePage:1 animated:YES];
	[vPhotoGallery scrollToBesidePage:-2 animated:YES];
	
All validation of page index are done for you and returned **YES** if the index is valid and scrolling is made, otherwise **NO**.

## UIPhotoGalleryViewController

As an extension, UIPhotoGalleryViewController is created to help simplify your process of creating a view controller for gallery browsing. This view controller already included a **UIPhotoGalleryView** item named **vPhotoGallery**, which is initialized with default configurations.

There are same properties with **UIPhotoGalleryView** that you can use to set for your **vPhotoGallery**, except **delegate** (by default, gallery's delegate is handled by the view controller itself):

	@property (nonatomic, assign) id<UIPhotoGalleryDataSource> dataSource;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) UIPhotoGalleryMode galleryMode;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) UIPhotoCaptionStyle captionStyle;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL circleScroll;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL peakSubView;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL verticalGallery;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat subviewGap;
	@property (nonatomic, assign) NSInteger initialIndex;

	@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL showStatusBar;

An additional property is included, **showStatusBar** to force hiding status bar if application status bar is visible. **_Noted:_** if this property is set to **YES**, navigation bar will be hidden too.

Beside default dataSource methods from **UIPhotoGalleryDataSource**, there are 2 additional methods to setup top & bottom view for gallery view controller:
	
	- (UIView*)customTopViewForGalleryViewController:(UIPhotoGalleryViewController*)galleryViewController;
	- (UIView*)customBottomViewForGalleryViewController:(UIPhotoGalleryViewController*)galleryViewController;

If these methods are not implemented, **UIPhotoGalleryViewController** provide 2 default views for top & bottom for essential actions (dismiss view controller, scroll next & previous page).

If implemented, a custom view will be placed at top or bottom of view controller respectively.

Otherwise, if these methods are implemented and returned **nil**, the respective view will be hidden from view controller.

By default, for gallery delegate handling, when user single tap in gallery, top and bottom view will be hidden with animation.

## Installation and dependencies

### Installation

For minimum requirement, add 4 following files to your project:

	UIPhotoGalleryView.h
	UIPhotoGalleryView.m
	UIPhotoItemView.h
	UIPhotoItemView.m

for **UIPhotoGalleryView** UI components & methods. The 2 additional files:

	UIPhotoGalleryViewController.h
	UIPhotoGalleryViewController.m

should be included only if you wants to use **UIPhotoGalleryViewController**.

### View setup

The **UIPhotoGalleryView** could be initialized using default method **initWithFrame:** or link the custom class from XIB file in following steps:

1. Go to your XIB file
2. Click on Files owner transparent box on the left
3. Open up your inspections tab(Third button on right in the View Section - in between Editor and Organizer)
4. Go to your identity Inspector(3rd from the left) underneath the editor organizer view tab.
5. Fix the custom class - Class option to whatever class you want it to respond to.

The **dataSource** and **delegate** can also be linked in Interface Builder.

### Depenencies

The project uses [**SDWebImage**](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage) as default image loading and displaying. Please follow [its installation instructions](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage#installation) to setup the project or customize your image loading methods inside **UIRemotePhotoItem** class implementation (_UIPhotoItemView.m_)
